Memepool is a bot for Discord.

Play meme sounds in your voice channel.

## Installation

```shell
export DISCORD_TOKEN=[your token]
yarn
yarn audio-server # enable sounds
yarn start # login the bot to your server
```

You will need a token API of Discord and a server with the bot added.

We are looking forward to deploy Memepool in the future, so anyone can use it.
